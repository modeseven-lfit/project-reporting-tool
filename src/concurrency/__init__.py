"""
Concurrency utilities for repository reporting system.

This package provides thread-safe abstractions for concurrent operations:
- JenkinsAllocationContext: Thread-safe Jenkins job allocation
- AdaptiveThreadPool: Dynamic thread pool with adaptive worker scaling
- HybridExecutor: Hybrid executor for CPU/IO-bound task routing
- ConcurrentErrorHandler: Structured error collection and retry logic
- CircuitBreaker: Circuit breaker pattern for fault tolerance

Phase 7: Concurrency Refinement - Enhanced concurrency primitives

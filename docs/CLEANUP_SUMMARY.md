# Documentation Cleanup Summary

**Date**: 2025-01-XX  
**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**Purpose**: Remove interim development documentation since tool not yet released

---

## Executive Summary

Successfully cleaned up all interim development documentation, refactoring artifacts, and migration guides from the repository. Since the tool has not been released yet, users don't need historical context about the development process.

**Result**: Clean, focused documentation containing only current implementation guides.

## Link Verification

All remaining documentation links verified:

- ✅ docs/INDEX.md: All links valid
- ✅ No broken references to deleted files
- ✅ No empty directories remaining

---

## Backup Created

Safety backup of all documentation created before cleanup:

```bash
docs-backup-20251107-2243.tar.gz (269K)
```

**Location**: `reporting-tool/docs-backup-*.tar.gz`

To restore backup if needed:
```bash
tar -xzf docs-backup-*.tar.gz
```

---

## Rationale

### Why Remove Migration Guides?

**Migration guides assume there's a previous version to migrate from.**

Since the tool has not been released yet:
- ❌ No users on "old version"
- ❌ No need to explain differences
- ❌ No breaking changes to document
- ✅ Users start fresh with current implementation

### Why Remove Refactoring Documentation?

**Refactoring docs are internal development history.**

For unreleased software:
- ❌ Users don't need to know how we got here
- ❌ "Before/after" comparisons are confusing
- ❌ Multiple completion reports create noise
- ✅ Users only need "what it is now"

### Why Remove Interim Reports?

**Status reports and checklists were development tools.**

They served their purpose but:
- ❌ Not relevant to end users
- ❌ Not relevant to future developers
- ❌ Outdated as soon as work completed
- ✅ Clean slate for v1.0.0 release

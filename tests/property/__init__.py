"""
Property-based tests using Hypothesis.

This package contains property-based tests that validate invariants,
mathematical properties, and edge cases across the domain models and
core logic.

Property-based testing generates random inputs according to strategies
and verifies that certain properties always hold, helping discover edge
cases that traditional example-based tests might miss.

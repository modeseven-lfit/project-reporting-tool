# Write-Good Linting Exceptions

This document explains the remaining write-good linting warnings and why they are acceptable in our technical documentation.

## Summary

After comprehensive review and improvements, we have **8 remaining write-good warnings** across 4 documentation files. These are intentional exceptions where the flagged phrases are either:

1. Technically precise and necessary
2. Part of ASCII art/diagrams
3. Grammatically appropriate for the context

---

## Acceptable Exceptions

### 1. "only" Usage (5 instances)

**Why Acceptable:** The word "only" is used for technical precision and clarity.

**Instances:**

1. `.github/scripts/README.md:53` - "landing page (production only)"
   - Clarifies this applies exclusively to production environment

2. `.github/scripts/README.md:141` - "(download-artifacts.sh only)"
   - Specifies which script the requirement applies to

3. `REPORTING_SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md:143` - "non-archived only"
   - Technical filter specification for repository selection

4. `REPORTING_SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md:194` - "first 2 projects only"
   - Precise resource limitation specification

5. `REPORTING_SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md:203` - "first 2 projects only"
   - Precise resource limitation specification

**Verdict:** ✅ Keep as-is - necessary for technical accuracy

---

### 2. "v" Repetition in ASCII Art (2 instances)

**Why Acceptable:** These are part of ASCII flow diagram syntax, not prose.

**Instances:**

1. `REPORTING_SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md:45` - Flow diagram arrow
2. `REPORTING_SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md:48` - Flow diagram arrow

**Example:**

```text
                         v                │
                    Generate Reports      │
                         v
```

**Verdict:** ✅ Keep as-is - required for diagram structure

---

### 3. Passive Voice: "been fixed" (1 instance)

**Why Acceptable:** Appropriate passive voice in executive summary context.

**Instance:**

- `TEST_RESULTS_FINAL.md:16` - "has been fixed"
  - Executive summary statement about system state
  - Focus is on the result, not the actor
  - Common and appropriate in technical status reports

**Verdict:** ✅ Keep as-is - grammatically appropriate

---

## Statistics

### Before Improvements

- **Total warnings:** 56
- **Files affected:** 4

### After Improvements

- **Total warnings:** 8
- **Files affected:** 3
- **Reduction:** 85.7%

### Warnings Addressed (48 fixed)

- ✅ Wordy/unneeded phrases (validate, monitor, implement, additional)
- ✅ Weasel words (completely, successfully, correctly, shortly)
- ✅ Unnecessary passive voice constructions
- ✅ Weakening qualifiers where precision was possible

---

## Pre-commit Configuration

The write-good hook is configured as **non-blocking** in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/jmfee-usgs/pre-commit-write-good
  rev: v1.0.3
  hooks:
    - id: write-good
      args: ['--no-passive']
      # Note: Exits with code 56 even for style suggestions
      # Remaining warnings are documented exceptions
```

---

## Recommendations

1. **Do not modify** the remaining 8 exceptions - they serve important technical purposes
2. **Review new content** for write-good suggestions during development
3. **Prioritize clarity** over strict adherence to style rules in technical documentation
4. **Update this document** if adding new intentional exceptions
